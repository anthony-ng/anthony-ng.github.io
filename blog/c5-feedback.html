      <h4>Feedbacks</h4>
      <h4>Established October 17th, 2014</h4>
      <p>Let's talk about feedbacks!</p>
      <p>Feedback is very important. Having feedback from others will allow you to able to reflect yourself in the view of others. When I read my feedback from others, I will also try to recall the pairing session me and the partners were having. I tried to connect to the whole scene, so that I will be able to truly reflect my behaviors. I mean, I like feedback. It is because I feel like everytime when I read some feedback, I will be able to improve the way I talk, the way I code, and the way I interact with others. Thus, feedback is definitely helpful to my learning.</p>
      <p>I also write feedbacks. When I write feedbacks, I try not to be too critical, but instead make it like an open discussion, and extend my opinions to others so that when the reader reads the feedback I wrote, they will be able to elaborate the idea I wanted to bring out. </p>
      <p>What about you? Do you like feedback? If so, why?</p>
