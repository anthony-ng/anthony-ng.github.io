      <h4>Conflict? How to deal with?</h4>
      <h4>Established Nov 5th, 2014</h4>
      <p>Have you ever seen the <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">compass of shame</a>? When people face a conflict, they will often use one of four strategies for dealing with shame including 1)Withdrawal 2)Attack Self 3)Avoidance and 4)Attack Others </p>
      <p>This is indeed a very interesting point, and I just have to agree that. To me, when I have conflict, I will probably try to "attack myself", because sometimes I will think of maybe its a good idea to diminish ourselves in the presence of others instead of "Withdrawal" where we can still stay connectect with others. I admit that there is a danger when I tried to attack myself, because the conflict can still build up inside and can lead to explisions or extremem voilence to others somethings. Thus, I've already tried to change, and improve my way to dael with conflict.</p>

      <h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
      <p>I can still recall that there is a time when I had to decide whether or not I should attend Dev Bootcamp since its a huge commitment in terms of time and money. I actually argued with my family for a while about it. We had different opionions, and we need to make the finally decision in a very short time period.</p>
      <h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
      <p>The source of the conflict might probably came from me mentioning this program to my family. Given it is a program that gonna spend a huge amount of my time and money, my family members initially disagree to let me join this program. They doubted that the program is really worth the time and the money.</p>
      <h4>How did you handle that conflict?</h4>
      <p>Initially, I tried to go with 1 of those 4 ways mentioned on "Compass of shame" - to "attack myself". I tried to start believing what they said because I didn't want to make my relationship with my family worse. However, I then decided to convince them that their point might not be correct by giving examples I found online showing that a coding bootcamp is indeed a good investment over time.</p>
      <h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>
      <p>My action actually make the conflict better. Fortunately my family members are all very open mind, and they are willing to listen to my voice. We gathered together and started analzing all the opinions again. Eventually, they are convinced by me, and let me to jon the program.</p>
      <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
      <p>I would probably do the same thing. It is because I feel like I were actually able to solve this conflict effectively.</p>
      <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
      <p>Always listen to others. And try to be open mind. Even if you have a strong point of view, you might still want to think from others point of view. Sometimes you might just realized something new.</p>
