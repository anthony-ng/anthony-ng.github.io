# DBC Week 1: My 1st Technical Blog
#### Version Control, git, and GitHub?
#### Established Sept 21st, 2014

Version control? What is that? As someone who has never landed into the programming's world, you will probably never hear this technical term before. However, after 10 hours of my 1st week at Dev Bootcamp, everything I learned just make so much sense, including version control, git, and developer's favorite - GitHub.

So when you have some new programming project, you are planning to store all the fils for that project in some new directory. You know that as time goes on, those files will change by a lot. Thus, every time you make some little changes, you record the change for future reference, like a snapshot - that's about it for version control.

And now we have Git. Git is a version control software, installed from your command line. It allows you to dave different "versions" of your work as you go - via adds and commits. As long as you've installed Git on your computer, you can start saving versions of your work. Isn't it pretty awesome!?

What about GitHub? Is it just Git? Not really. As GitHub is more like an "online" version of Git, you can access all the different versions of your project remotely - like Dropbox to a USB drive! it will store your identical working directories - aka repositories, from/to your collaborator, update each other's progress - just like a hub for Git repositories. So why is it good stuff? Because not only you can have your colleague review your code anytime and anywhere, but you can also sync with your colleague no matter what updates and merges occur. AWESOME!
