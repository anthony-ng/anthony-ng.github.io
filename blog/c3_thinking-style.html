      <h4>Thinking Style and Programmer Mindsets</h4>
      <h4>Established Oct 5th, 2014</h4>
      <p>When talking about thinking style, everyone is different. It is because we all have our preferred way to think. You can be a Concrete Random guys, or you can be a ABSTRACT SEQUENTIAL guys. So it really depends.</p>
      <p>Then what about me? Wells, I am actually more like an ABSTRACT RANDOM guys in terms of thinking style.</p>
      <p>So what is it like being an Abstract Random person? Good question!</p>
      <p>Abstract random thinkers organize information throught reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented invironments. Says DePorter: "The 'real' world for abstract random learners is the world of feelings and emotions. The AR's mind absorbs ideas, information and impressions and organizes them through reflection. They remember best if information is personalised. They feel constricted when they're subjected to a very structured environment."</p>
      <p>Isn't it interesting? As an AR thinker, I agree that I usually use my natural ability to work with others. And I cannot deny that emotions and feelings stronly influence your concentration. I just feel like doing that!</p>
      <p>What is your thinking style? Feel free to share with me! :-)</p>
