      <h3>DBC Week 1: My 1st Cultural Blog</h3>
      <h4>Chefs in the Kitchen</h4>
      <h4>Established Sept 21st, 2014</h4>
      <p>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
      <p>1st week at DBC officially ends after I finished writing this blog. I have to admit, I did learnt a lot about programming from a complete n00b to "beginner" now. Version control, command line, Git, GitHub, basic Ruby, etc. I just couldn't belive it!</p>
      <p>So far, I have a good experience at DBC. I feel like this place is not just a bootcamp who teach you how to code for tuition, but there are actually a lot more than that. To me, DBC is more like a school to teach you how to become a well-round good software develper by emphasizing on its culture, value, EQ training, and Yoga! This is definitely something new to me, since I haven't been in school for a long time.</p>
      <p>However, I do see this is a good thing. And I believe this is what I was expecting from the beginning when I first decided to apply for DBC. To learn coding, there are already thousands of resources online. But it is always hard for an outsider to have the training to become a good porgrammer who works in fast paced team environment. So I think I found my reason to stay at DBC, and I believe I am just feeling good.</p>
