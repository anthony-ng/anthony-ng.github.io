      <h4>Ruby: Array vs. Hash</h4>
      <h4>Established Oct 5th, 2014</h4>
      <p>Oftern time, rubyist will get confused about array and hash. It is because these 2 young brothers look very simialr. So how should we handle them? Good quesion.</p>
      <p>So I guess most of us already know what array is. Let's talk about hashes! Hashes are a lot like arrays: they have a bunch of slots that can point to various onjects. However, in an array, the slots are lined up in a row, and each one is numbered (starting from zero). In a hash, the slots aren't in a row (they are just sort of jumbled together)! Therefore, you can use any object to refer to a slot, not just a number.</p>
      <p>I see....Then why do we use Hash over Array? Well, it is good to use hashes when you havae a bunch of things you want to keep track of but they don't really fit into an ordered list.<p>
      <p>I hope it helps!</p>
