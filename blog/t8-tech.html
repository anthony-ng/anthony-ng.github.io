      <h4>What is Rails?</h4>
      <h4>Established Nov 5th, 2014</h4>
      <p>What is Rails? Probably most Ruby beginner will have this question when they first learned Ruby. What is the relationship between Ruby and Rails? Let me give you a very brief introduction about Rails.</p>
      <p>Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is an open source web application framework written in Ruby. Rails is a full-stack framework that emphasizes the use of well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), the active record pattern, and model–view–controller (MVC).</p>
      <h4>Technical overview</h4>
      <p>Like many web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern to organize application programming.<p>
      <p>In a default configuration, a model in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database, and a Ruby file. For example, a model class User will usually be defined in the file user.rb in the app/models directory, and is linked to the table users in the database. Developers can choose any model name, file name or database table name. But this is not common practice and usually discouraged according to the "convention over configuration" philosophy.<p>

      <p>A controller is a component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models directly for information and pass these on to the view. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as: create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes configuration file.<p>

      <h4>Reception</h4>
      <p>Rails running on Matz's Ruby Interpreter (the de facto reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.These critics often mentioned various Twitter outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter's partial transition to Scala (which runs on the Java Virtual Machine) for their queueing system and other middleware.[42][43] The user interface aspects of the site continued to run Ruby on Rails until 2011 when it was replaced due to concerns over performance</p>
      </p>

      <p>So, I hope now you have some basic understand about what Rails is, and how is it interact with Ruby. I hope you will learn Rails soon!<p>
