      <h4>Stereotype Threat</h4>
      <h4>Established October 24th, 2014</h4>
      <p>Accorfing to "Steele & Aronson, 1995", Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. This term was first used by Steele and Aronson (1995) who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students. The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes. </p>
      <p>To me, stereotype just happens all the time. As an international student and also an Asian, it has been affecting me since I first came to the United States 6 years ago for college.</p>
      <p>I can still recall that when I first came to college, there wasa a stereotype that local americans believe Asian don't speak English. Thus, at that time, there were actually quite a few other local students refused to talk to me, or try to mock at me given my English ability. This is definitely not true and appropriate. Although I do agree that this steretype were created given the history that US immigrants were poor and poor-educated, however, there are also many international students who received decent education in their hometown but still decided to study abroad in order to widen their horizon. Personally, I could speak decent English at the time when I entered college. But I can still definitely expericen that stereotype even when I am graduated from college last year. I guess it is not something you can change easily. Perhaps it takes years or decades? But that is also what make America special.</p>
