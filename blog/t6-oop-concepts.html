      <h4>Object-Oriented vs. Functional Programming</h4>
      <h4>Established October 24th, 2014</h4>
      <p>Since I've learned a bit about object-oriented programming this week, I would like to share something I learned.</p>
      <p>Let's talk about Object-Oriented vs. Functional Programming. When people discuss this topic, they always argue one is better than the other one. But is it really the case? Let's find out!</p>
      <p>The central tenet of OOP is that data and the operations upon it are tightly coupled: An object owns its data and it owns the implementation of the operations on the data. It hides those from other objects via its interface, a collection of methods or messages it responds to. Thus, the central model for abstraction is the data itself, hidden as it is behind a small API in the form of its interface.</p>
      <p>The central tenet of FP is that data is only loosely coupled to functions. You can write different operations on the same data structure, and the central model for abstraction is the function, not the data structure. Functions hide their implementation, and the language’s abstractions speak to functions and they way they are combined or expressed, such as generic functions or combinators.</p>
      <p>Now, A well-crafted OO architecture makes changing the way things are put together easy. All that hiding and decoupling allows you to change the relationships between things easily. OO does not make adding new operations particularly easy, you see this whenever you find yourself muttering about “double dispatch and visitors.”</p>

    <p>But if you have a business process for placing an order that is being refactored to handle new business rules, this is where OO shines. Those things that don’t need to know about the change are insulated from those that do.</p>
    <p>Right? So you can see that the answer to the question I doubted at the beginning is really up to you. Someone might prefer OO more, while someone might like Functional programming more.</p>
    <p>What do you think? Lets share your opinion too!</p>
