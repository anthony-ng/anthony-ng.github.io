# Anthony Ng's Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website to showcase my past projects and to give a brief self-introduction to the readers. The goal is make it easier for people to get connected with me.

Visitors are able to:
* click on the projects which opens the project in a new tab
* click on the social-media icons(LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub) to get in touch with me
* click on the resume page to view my most updated resume

It was my 1st repo, and I enjoyed building it!
