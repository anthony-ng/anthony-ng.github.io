      <h4>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h4>
      <h4>Established Nov 2nd, 2014</h4>
      <p>When I think of the last time in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest. and the most satisfied, the following values come to my mind:</p>
      <h4>Accomplishment</h4>
      <p>I like having the feeling of accomplishment. It always makes you fell happy, proud, and satistied. It is because when you set some goal for yourself, you are expecting yourself to accomplish it no matter what obstacles you have out there. Therefore, when you were able to accomplish something, it shows that you have the ability to promise yourself. It tells yourself that you are capable of doing something difficult.</p>
      <h4>Confidence</h4>
      <p>Having confidence is very important to me. It is because I always believe that when you are happy, you are always confident during that moment. Being confident about something means you have faith about it, you are good at it, and you are willing to accomplish it no matter what. Thus, being confident in your life is very important, especially during some important moment in your life: Taking an exam, Meeting someone important, Doing something impactful, etc. Sometimes, I believe that the more confident you are, the more happier you are.</p>
      <h4>Reputation</h4>
      <p>People wants reputation. I can think of reputation is the value of your personal brand. The more reputation you have, the better your personal brand is. So that also means if you have a very high reputation, people will believe that you are credible, reliable, trustable and powerful. Therefore, when I felt like I was proudest person in the world, I actually believe I have a very high value of reputation among all others. </p>
      <p>In summary, I strongly agree those values I mentioned above. If I have to rate, it would be 5 on a scale of 1 to 5</p>
      <p>The last topic that someone asked my advice on was my friend who needed to decide whether he should go back to his hometown while giving up the legal status in the United States. Since that is a very serious topic, I tried to analyze the pros and cons of both optiopns with him. I believe I successfully express the values I mentioned above: Confidence and Reputation because thats probably why my friend had decided to come to me and ask for advice. Eventually, we were able to come up witha a conclusion where he could make the finally decision.</p>
      <p>So this is what I think of values. What value do you agree?</p>
