      <h4>Patent legislation</h4>
      <h4>Established October 10th, 2014</h4>
      <p>Today I want to talk about some issues that is happening in the tech industry. To me, the whole tech world is kinda new. However, I do believe it is time to learn more about what's really happening out there, especially when I really start working in the tech industry.</p>
      <p>Congress passed major patent reform legislation just a few years ago, and most observers predicted it would be a generation before Congress returned to the issue. </p>
      <p>But the problem of "patent trolls" — firms that use bogus patent suits to extort settlements out of businesses — has escalated so quickly that Congress is now poised to pass new legislation to curb abuse.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley, retail groups and other business interests are lobbying hard for legislation to crack down on patent trolls. But one major fissure has emerged —Google wants companies to be empowered to challenge the validity of software patents, while Microsoft strongly opposes the proposal. </p>
      <p>Some judges and trial lawyers have also expressed concern about a provision that would force courts to award legal fees to winning parties in certain cases. </p>
      <p>The House approved patent legislation from Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) in December, and the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to move its own bill in the New Year. </p>
      <p>So this is only one of many issues that is happening nowadays in the tech industry. Do you have more to share?</p>
