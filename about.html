      <p>My name is Anthony Ng and I am a recent graduate majoring in Statistics with concentration in Finance at the University of California, Berkeley.<br>I'm also a paragrapher who enjoy sharing pictures to others. I mostly film with Leica M6 for my adventures.</p>
      <p>After working as a technical consultant at a leading IT consulting firm for 10 months, I feel like my true passion is developing solutions but not just analyzing them. <br>Thus I joined Dev Bootcamp and hope to become a super Web Developer soon!<br>So...sit tight and look forward to my soon to be released AWESOME PROJECTS!</p>
