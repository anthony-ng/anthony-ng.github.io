      <h4>JavaScript VS Ruby</h4>
      <h4>Nov 2nd, 2014</h4>
      <p>When people mention JavaScript, they always think of it is the language of web. However, Ruby also plays a very important role in web application nowadays. So what is the real difference between JavaScript and Ruby?</p>
      <h4>typeof vs class</h4>
      <p>To determine what type of value something is (a number, a fixnum, a string, an Object, an array, etc), in JavaScript you write typeof and then then the object; in Ruby, you append .class to the end of the object.</p>
      <h4>=== vs ==</h4>
      <p>In JavaScript, the triple equals sign helps determine if two objects are the same exact object (having the same typeof and the same value). For example: 3 === 3 returns true In Ruby, that is accomplished through the double equals. (3 == 3 returns true)</p>
      <p>JavaScript has its own double equals, which shouldn’t be confused with Ruby’s: double equals in JavaScript only determines if the values match. For example: "3" == 3 returns true</p>
      <h4>Objects</h4>
      <p>Objects (similar to Ruby’s hash), declared as variables, are a way of organizing key/value pairs. For example, var cat = {color: "grey", name: "Spot", age: "12"}; To access the value of an associated key, you can call that on the variable name: cat.name returns "Spot". You can also easily delete a key/value pair by writing delete cat.name. To declare a new key/value pair, write: cat.gender = "male";. This appends this new data point to the end of the Object.</p>
      <h4>Arrays</h4>
      <p>Both Ruby and JavaScript have Arrays, which are more of less logically the same; however, the Object Array functions (JavaScript) and the Class Array methods (Ruby) have different syntax. For example, to find the index of an element in an array, in JavaScript you write arrayName.indexOf("element");. In Ruby, this is accomplished by array_name.index("element")</p>
      <p>And of course, there are still a lot of difference between JavaScript and Ruby. Can you identify some?</p>

      <h4>Ruby: Array vs. Hash</h4>
      <h4>Established Oct 5th, 2014</h4>
      <p>Oftern time, rubyist will get confused about array and hash. It is because these 2 young brothers look very simialr. So how should we handle them? Good quesion.</p>
      <p>So I guess most of us already know what array is. Let's talk about hashes! Hashes are a lot like arrays: they have a bunch of slots that can point to various onjects. However, in an array, the slots are lined up in a row, and each one is numbered (starting from zero). In a hash, the slots aren't in a row (they are just sort of jumbled together)! Therefore, you can use any object to refer to a slot, not just a number.</p>
      <p>I see....Then why do we use Hash over Array? Well, it is good to use hashes when you havae a bunch of things you want to keep track of but they don't really fit into an ordered list.<p>
      <p>A simple example: <br>In Array, things are ordered by a list such as 'a, b, c, d, etc...'<br>In Hash, its more like a collection of key/value pairs: 'Ada has c, Bob has d, Chris has a, and Daniel has b, etc...'</p>
      <p>I hope it helps!</p>

      <h4>Thinking Style and Programmer Mindsets</h4>
      <h4>Established Oct 5th, 2014</h4>
      <p>When talking about thinking style, everyone is different. It is because we all have our preferred way to think. You can be a Concrete Random guys, or you can be a ABSTRACT SEQUENTIAL guys. So it really depends.</p>
      <p>Then what about me? Wells, I am actually more like an ABSTRACT RANDOM guys in terms of thinking style.</p>
      <p>So what is it like being an Abstract Random person? Good question!</p>
      <p>Abstract random thinkers organize information throught reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented invironments. Says DePorter: "The 'real' world for abstract random learners is the world of feelings and emotions. The AR's mind absorbs ideas, information and impressions and organizes them through reflection. They remember best if information is personalised. They feel constricted when they're subjected to a very structured environment."</p>
      <p>Isn't it interesting? As an AR thinker, I agree that I usually use my natural ability to work with others. And I cannot deny that emotions and feelings stronly influence your concentration. I just feel like doing that!</p>
      <p>What is your thinking style? Feel free to share with me! :-)</p>

      <h4>CSS Concept: <br>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning</h4>
      <h4>Established Oct 1st, 2014</h4>
      <p>Web developer use CSS for styling their websites, making them look fancy and beautiful. And one of the most important factor here is positioning. So what exactly do developer position thing in a website? Read on...</p>
      <p>Controlling the position of HTML elements allows you incredibly fine control over how your pages look. In CSS, there are 3 types of positioning: relative, absolute, and fixed. And the difference is quite obvious. Let's talk about relative first.</p>
      <p>Relative positioning is very straight-forward: it tells the element to move relative to where it would have landed if it just had the default static positioning.<br>If you give an element relative positioning and tell it to have a <em>margin-top</em> of <em>10px</em>, it doesn't move down ten pixels from any particular thing - instead, it moves down ten pixels from where it <em>otherwise would have been</em>.</p>
      <p>What about absolute? When an element is set to <em>absolute position</em>, it's then positioned in relation to the first parent element it has that <em>doesn't</em> have position:<em>static</em>.<br>If there is no such element, the element with position: absolute gets positioned relative to <em>&lt;html&gt;</em>.</p>
      <p>Finally, fixed positioning.<br>Fiexed positioning anchors an element to the brower window - you can think of it as gluing the element to the screen. If you scroll up and down, the fixed element stays put even as other elements scroll past! Funny!</p>
      <p>As a result, all three positioning has different purposes, and it really comes down the actual requirement when a developer decide which positioning he or she needs. I hope this simple technical blog helps!</p>

      <h4>Version Control, git, and GitHub?</h4>
      <h4>Established Sept 21st, 2014</h4>
      <p>Version control? What is that? As someone who has never landed into the programming's world, you will probably never hear this technical term before. However, after 10 hours of my 1st week at Dev Bootcamp, everything I learned just make so much sense, including version control, git, and developer's favorite - GitHub.</p>
      <p>So when you have some new programming project, you are planning to store all the fils for that project in some new directory. You know that as time goes on, those files will change by a lot. Thus, every time you make some little changes, you record the change for future reference, like a snapshot - that's about it for version control.</p>
      <p>And now we have Git. Git is a version control software, installed from your command line. It allows you to dave different "versions" of your work as you go - via adds and commits. As long as you've installed Git on your computer, you can start saving versions of your work. Isn't it pretty awesome!?</p>
      <p>What about GitHub? Is it just Git? Not really. As GitHub is more like an "online" version of Git, you can access all the different versions of your project remotely - like Dropbox to a USB drive! it will store your identical working directories - aka repositories, from/to your collaborator, update each other's progress - just like a hub for Git repositories. So why is it good stuff? Because not only you can have your colleague review your code anytime and anywhere, but you can also sync with your colleague no matter what updates and merges occur. AWESOME!</p>

      <h4>Chefs in the Kitchen</h4>
      <h4>Established Sept 21st, 2014</h4>
      <p>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
      <p>1st week at DBC officially ends after I finished writing this blog. I have to admit, I did learnt a lot about programming from a complete n00b to "beginner" now. Version control, command line, Git, GitHub, basic Ruby, etc. I just couldn't belive it!</p>
      <p>So far, I have a good experience at DBC. I feel like this place is not just a bootcamp who teach you how to code for tuition, but there are actually a lot more than that. To me, DBC is more like a school to teach you how to become a well-round good software develper by emphasizing on its culture, value, EQ training, and Yoga! This is definitely something new to me, since I haven't been in school for a long time.</p>
      <p>However, I do see this is a good thing. And I believe this is what I was expecting from the beginning when I first decided to apply for DBC. To learn coding, there are already thousands of resources online. But it is always hard for an outsider to have the training to become a good porgrammer who works in fast paced team environment. So I think I found my reason to stay at DBC, and I believe I am just feeling good.</p>
