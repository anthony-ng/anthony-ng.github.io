      <h3>DBC Week 1: My 1st Cultural Blog</h3>
      <h4>Chefs in the Kitchen</h4>
      <h4>Established Sept 21st, 2014</h4>
      <p>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
      <p>1st week at DBC officially ends after I finished writing this blog. I have to admit, I did learnt a lot about programming from a complete n00b to "beginner" now. Version control, command line, Git, GitHub, basic Ruby, etc. I just couldn't belive it!</p>
      <p>So far, I have a good experience at DBC. I feel like this place is not just a bootcamp who teach you how to code for tuition, but there are actually a lot more than that. To me, DBC is more like a school to teach you how to become a well-round good software develper by emphasizing on its culture, value, EQ training, and Yoga! This is definitely something new to me, since I haven't been in school for a long time.</p>
      <p>However, I do see this is a good thing. And I believe this is what I was expecting from the beginning when I first decided to apply for DBC. To learn coding, there are already thousands of resources online. But it is always hard for an outsider to have the training to become a good porgrammer who works in fast paced team environment. So I think I found my reason to stay at DBC, and I believe I am just feeling good.</p>

      <h3>DBC Week 1: My 1st Technical Blog</h3>
      <h4>Version Control, git, and GitHub?</h4>
      <h4>Established Sept 21st, 2014</h4>
      <p>Version control? What is that? As someone who has never landed into the programming's world, you will probably never hear this technical term before. However, after 10 hours of my 1st week at Dev Bootcamp, everything I learned just make so much sense, including version control, git, and developer's favorite - GitHub.</p>
      <p>So when you have some new programming project, you are planning to store all the fils for that project in some new directory. You know that as time goes on, those files will change by a lot. Thus, every time you make some little changes, you record the change for future reference, like a snapshot - that's about it for version control.</p>
      <p>And now we have Git. Git is a version control software, installed from your command line. It allows you to dave different "versions" of your work as you go - via adds and commits. As long as you've installed Git on your computer, you can start saving versions of your work. Isn't it pretty awesome!?</p>
      <p>What about GitHub? Is it just Git? Not really. As GitHub is more like an "online" version of Git, you can access all the different versions of your project remotely - like Dropbox to a USB drive! it will store your identical working directories - aka repositories, from/to your collaborator, update each other's progress - just like a hub for Git repositories. So why is it good stuff? Because not only you can have your colleague review your code anytime and anywhere, but you can also sync with your colleague no matter what updates and merges occur. AWESOME!</p>
